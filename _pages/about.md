I’m Haodong Chen, a PhD Fellow in the Center for Clinical and Translational Research at Seattle Children’s Hospital and a Ph.D. graduate in Mechanical Engineering from the [Missouri University of Science and Technology](https://www.mst.edu/) under the mentorship of [Dr. Ming C. Leu](https://sites.mst.edu/mingleu/) and [Dr. Zhaozheng Yin](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/zhaozhengyin). My primary research revolves around Industrial AI, computer vision, signal processing, and smart manufacturing systems. I have a strong background in machine learning, deep learning, and developing intelligent systems for industry and healthcare applications.

My work and research
======
My research interests span a wide range of technical fields, including Industrial AI and smart manufacturing. I’m particularly passionate about using machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) techniques to enable real-time action recognition, and disease diagnosis assistance and rehabilitation. My work integrates sensor fusion, signal processing, and deep learning to create intelligent, human-centered manufacturing systems. Some of the highlights of my research contributions include:
- CNO/CRMO Analysis: Applied ML and CV to whole-body MRI for Chronic Nonbacterial Osteomyelitis lesion detection and scoring.
- Smart Manufacturing: Designed real-time multi-modal human-robot collaboration systems for smart manufacturing, integrating gesture, speech, and pose-based controls.
- Industrial AI Applications: Created machine learning models for assembly task recognition, which achieved 95%+ accuracy on multiple benchmark datasets.
- Healthcare Technology: Developed a cognitive rehabilitation system leveraging robotics and computer vision to support mild cognitive impairment rehabilitation.
- Published over 20 peer-reviewed research papers focusing on machine learning, computer vision, and smart manufacturing.
My work has been recognized at international conferences and featured in leading academic journals. I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with industry giants like Peloton Interactive.

My personal life
======
Beyond research, I’m driven by a passion for continuous learning and exploration. Here’s a glimpse into my personal interests:
- Traveler: I’m an avid traveler, always eager to explore new cultures and cuisines.
- Fitness and Well-Being: I value physical and mental well-being, often engaging in swimming, hiking, and other fitness activities.

With a passion for both research and development, I’m dedicated to advancing the fields of AI and smart manufacturing while also contributing to the well-being of society through innovative, real-world solutions.
